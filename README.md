### What's a Web Socket?
A web socket helps us communicate with a client, and a server in *real time*! 

Think of a group chat in Slack or Discord. When you're sending a message about that upcoming deadline to your colleagues, or a Slack poll about which whether or not Nickelodeon is better than Cartoon Network, all of your colleagues in the group chat will receive that message immediately after you've sent it.

### Why Use Web Sockets?
Web sockets were designed around the HTTP send/recieve paradigm. Because web sockets are real time, we don't have to wait for a response from either endpoint, and we don't have to deal with the overhead that comes from making an HTTP request.
